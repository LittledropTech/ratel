# Ratel â€” The Fearless Bitcoin Wallet for Gen Z and Gen Alpha

Ratel is a Bitcoin-only, non-custodial mobile wallet inspired by the honey badger â€” also known as the ratel â€” a symbol of resilience and fearlessness.

This wallet is designed for the new wave of Bitcoiners: Gen Z and Gen Alpha. People who create, learn, game, and value privacy, expression, and usability over traditional finance.

## Why Ratel?

Bitcoin deserves better than boring wallets.

Ratel is built not just for storage, but for experience. It combines real utility with culture:

- Earn sats while learning or gaming  
- Share wallet addresses through expressive, encrypted emojis  
- Back up your wallet using a poem  
- Interact with Bitcoin in a way that feels intuitive and native to the next generation of digital users  

Ratel isnâ€™t just a wallet â€” itâ€™s a cultural bridge.
